Open Annotations can easily be shared between platforms, with sufficient richness of expression to satisfy complex requirements while remaining simple enough to also allow for the most common use cases, such as attaching a piece of text to a single web resource.

An Annotation is considered to be a set of connected resources, typically including a body and target, where the body is somehow about the target. The full model supports additional functionality, enabling semantic annotations, embedding content, selecting segments of resources, choosing the appropriate representation of a resource and providing styling hints for consuming clients."""@en ;

Tags are typically keywords or labels, and used for organization, description or discovery of the resource being tagged. In the Semantic Web, URIs are used instead of strings to avoid the issue of polysemy where one word has multiple meanings, such usage MUST be indicated using the subclass oa:SemanticTag.

Annotations that tag resources, either with text or semantic tags, SHOULD also have the oa:tagging motivation to make the reason for the Annotation more clear to applications, and MAY have other motivations as well."""@en ;

The SVG document should either be retrievable by resolving the URI of this resource, or be included as an Embedded Resource using cnt:Content.

It is RECOMMENDED that the document contain only a single shape element and that element SHOULD be one of: path, rect, circle, ellipse, polyline, polygon or g. The g element SHOULD ONLY be used to construct a multi-element group, for example to define a donut shape requiring an outer circle and a clipped inner circle.

The dimensions of both the shape and the SVG canvas MUST be relative to the dimensions of the Source resource. For example, given an image which is 600 pixels by 400 pixels, and the desired section is a circle of 100 pixel radius at the center of the image, then the SVG element would be: <circle cx=\"300\" cy=\"200\" r=\"100\"/>

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to include style information within the SVG element, nor Javascript, animation, text or other non shape oriented information. Clients SHOULD ignore such information if present."""@en ;
